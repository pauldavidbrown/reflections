1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It sets up some hidden files and the .git directory which stores meta data about the files in the parent directory

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows you choose what files should be committed, it also allows you to use git reset - to remove files from staging
